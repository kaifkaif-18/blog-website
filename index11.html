          <p>For nearly every incendiary piece of legislation, attempt to restrict access to resources, or rollback of digital protections and safe spaces proffered in 2023, a multiplied wave of activism has followed in its wake. 
        </p>

          <p>
            The year proved to be a test of will between those in power and the communities they represent, a show of force that pits institutional might against the force of human compassion.</p>
          
          <p>Communities virtually linked arms in solidarity amid debates on the rights afforded to Americans, with an intertwining of mutual aid efforts to fund abortion networks, transgender healthcare, and Indigenous-led climate change solutions among the many calls to pool resources to generate action. Social movements had their wins, like the union efforts of creatives and performers nationwide, while many still continue the fight for basic protections.

            And on the ground, youth voices once again rang through, leading calls for action.
          </p>
          <p><b>Gun reform activists take over Las Vegas.</b><br>In January, a group of activists from youth-led gun violence prevention organization Students Demand Action took on the gun lobby directly at a series of activations and protests in Las Vegas, demanding the industry leaders finally prioritize the safety of young people and communities nationwide.

            The activists projected 50-foot signs, erected billboards, and passed out flyers to attendees of the Las Vegas National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF)'s annual trade show, known as the SHOT Show. In the words of organizer Sari Kaufman, "It's amazing that young people from across the country are the ones leading this fight. I also think it sometimes creates a challenge, because older folks will look at it and think, 'Oh, they're young and naive.' That bothers me the most. Yeah, sure, we're young. But we are sophisticated in our thinking."</p> 
          <p>
           <b> Florida Walkout 2 Learn movement calls out bigotry and censorship.</b><br>
           Responding to the political efforts in education of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and legislative decisions of the state's conservative majority, Florida students organized a mass walkout of public schools in April, building on similar protest movements from 2022. 

           The group, known as Walkout 2 Learn, decried the censorship of LGBTQ history and discriminatory policies in schools, the rejection of Black history curriculum content, and a variety of other recent bills that limit the freedoms of students and educators statewide. Activists were backed by youth-founded organization The Social Equity through Education Alliance, actor Beanie Feldstein, Florida Democratic leadership, and numerous TikTok fan favorites who joined virtual and on-the-ground rallies. Walkout 2 Learn's events also modeled a unique tool for democratic protest: a five-minute history course for all participants, in addition to access to a virtual, college-level African American studies course.
           
           The walkout movement continued in other states as well, including among public school students in Louisiana, Iowa, and Utah, in response to similar anti-LGBTQ policies.           </p>
          <p><b>Young activists descend on Nashville in pro-democracy rally. </b><br>
            April also saw one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations so far this year, as youth gun reform advocates joined Tennessee activists in demanding accountability from the state's leadership after the March 27 Nashville school shooting and subsequent ousting of pro-protester lawmakers.

The grounds of Nashville's capitol building were the organizing site for thousands of young people, many from Students Demand Action and March for Our Lives, who would later gather in the rotunda to put vocal pressure on legislators to retain Democratic members threatened with expulsion and to pass safety legislation.

The "anti-fascism" demonstration made headlines nationwide, and encapsulated the frustrations and perseverance of social justice advocates.
