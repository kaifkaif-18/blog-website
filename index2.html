          <span>Article 370 Review: Yami Gautam Starrer Gives A Civics Lesson With Much Ass Kissing</span>
          <p>Second half is a major let down</p>

          <p>Aditya Dhar produced Article 370 is a screenplay from a singular point of view which claims and then sets out to prove all is well that ends well. Article 370 aims to give the audience a civics lesson but unfortunately, it comes with some ass-kissing which could have been easily avoided. The last 10 minutes of the run time, certainly takes the fun out of the film, because at that point, it becomes immensely clear that the film is about more than just the story it intended to tell. A news cutting at the end of the film literally says 'politician fulfils his promise 30 years later, what will he do next?'. That is not what the film promised, nor what the title suggests.</p>
          <p>As expected from a film based on some true events and incidents, the run time includes much narration. Ajay Devgn introduces the history of India's separation from Pakistan as well as somewhat the political situation in Kashmir and how part of the state was then turned over to Pakistan which is now called Azad Kashmir. We are soon brought forward years later in August 2019, during a Rajya Sabha meeting at which the bill to abolish Article 370 was introduced and passed.</p>
          <p>But before we get to see that, the flashback begins from 2016 with Zooni Haksar played by Yami Gautam who has been part of the team tracking Burhan Wani for years. When she finally finds him, she refuses to wait for an order from the superior and takes the matter into her own hands. While they do manage to get him, Burhan is killed while trying to get away. His death led to a massive backlash and people walked out on the streets, calling out the government. The makers have also used real footage from the incident which helps their case. However, it does not last till the second half.</p>
          <p>The first half focuses on Zooni's story, her struggle as a Kashmiri and being a member of the armed forces. She is hell-bent on working to safeguard her home. But as years pass by and she is reprimanded for the Burhan Wani incident, her faith also dies down. Until Priyamani's Rajeshwari Swaminathan shows up with a plan. Yami manages to get in many good scenes throughout the run time. Some as a real armed forces officer, some that show her guns blazing and others where she gets to give an emotional monologue. On the other hand, Priyamani also gets some of the best scenes in the film, even if it often shows her instructing people or walking behind politicians, her presence is felt in every scene which is refreshing to watch.</p>
          <p>Both women lead the film with a strong hand, at least for the first half because later on they are cheated out of their contribution. The politicians take center stage quickly and remain the center of the story despite the film exploring a 180-degree view of the situation. Apart from the political struggle, and the military actions, the film also talks about the incident's presence in media, its social impact and more. What the film does fail to capture is how the situation does impact the people stuck in Kashmir.</p>
          <p>The worldview of the incident is pretty much from a bird's viewpoint and not on the ground. The big picture looks good, terrorists were taken care of, and promises were made, even on the screen they are made, but it is unclear if the truth is being told about the on-ground situation at the time. While the first half explores the lanes of Kashmir with the military, the second half stays away from the situation stuck in the parliament, focusing on the politicians and their glory.</p>
