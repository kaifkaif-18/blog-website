          <span>What Parents Need To Tell Their Kids About Explicit Deepfakes</span>
          <p>Don't Delay this critical Conversation.</p>

          <p>If the day hasn't arrived yet, it's coming: You need to talk to your child about explicit deepfakes.
        </p>

          <p>
The problem may have seemed abstract until fake pornographic images of Taylor Swift, generated by artificial intelligence, went viral on the social media platform X/Twitter. Now the issue simply can't be ignored, say online child safety experts.</p>
          
          <p>"When that happens to [Swift], I think kids and parents start to realize that no one is immune from this," says Laura Ordoñez, executive editor and head of digital media and family at Common Sense Media.
          </p>
          <p>1. You don't need to be an expert on deepfakes to talk about them.
            Adam Dodge, founder of The Tech-Savvy Parent, says parents who feel like they need to thoroughly understand deepfakes in advance of a conversation with their child needn't worry about seeming like, or becoming, an expert.
            
            Instead, all that's required is a basic grasp of the concept that AI-powered software and algorithms make it shockingly easy to create realistic explicit or pornographic deepfakes, and that such technology is easy to access online. In fact, children as young as elementary school students may encounter apps or software with this capability and use them to create deepfakes with little technical challenges or barriers.
            
            "What I tell parents is, 'Look you need to understand how early and often kids are getting exposed to this technology, that it's happening earlier than you realize, and appreciate how dangerous it is.'"
            
            Dodge says parents need to be prepared to address the possibilities that their child will be targeted by the technology; that they'll view inappropriate content; or that they'll participate in creating or sharing fake explicit images.</p> 
          <p>
            2. Make it a conversation, not a lecture.
            If you're sufficiently alarmed by these possibilities, try to avoid rushing into a hasty discussion of deepfakes. Instead, Ordoñez recommends bringing up the topic in an open-ended, nonjudgmental way, asking your child what they know or have heard about deepfakes.
            
            She adds that it's important to think of AI image-based abuse as a form of online manipulation that exists on the same spectrum as misinformation or disinformation. With that framework, reflecting on deepfakes becomes an exercise in critical thinking.
            
            Ordoñez says that parents can help their child learn the signs that imagery has been manipulated. Though the rapid evolution of AI means some of these telltale signs no longer show up, Ordoñez says it's still useful to point out that any deepfake (not just the explicit kind) might be identifiable through face discoloration, lighting that seems off, and blurriness where the neck and hair meet.
            
            Parents can also learn alongside their child, says Ordoñez. This might involve reading and talking about non-explicit AI-generated fake content together, like the song Heart on My Sleeve, released in May 2023, that claimed to use AI versions of the voices of Drake and The Weeknd. While that story has relatively low stakes for children, it can prompt a meaningful conversation about how it might feel to have your voice used without your consent.
            
            Parents might take an online quiz with their child that asks the participant to correctly identify which face is real and which is generated by AI, another low-stakes way of confronting together how easily AI-generated images can dupe the viewer.
            
            The point of these activities is to teach your child how to start an ongoing dialogue and develop the critical thinking skills that will surely be tested as they encounter explicit deepfakes and the technology that creates them.
