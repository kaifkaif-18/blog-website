          <p>If your kid has gone online more than a few times, chances are they've seen or encountered something inappropriate.
        </p>

          <p>
            That could be pornography, violence, bullying, disordered eating, messages from strangers, suicidal thinking or behavior, and even child sexual abuse material.

            It happens probably more than children and teens will ever admit. After all, describing such content — and how they found or received it — can make for an awkward conversation with a parent.</p>
          
          <p>"But all of that disturbing content, and more, is online for them to discover, and it can negatively affect their mental health, says Dr. Janis Whitlock, a senior advisor at The Jed Foundation (JED).

            Young people may see something that causes a profound sense of worry about their safety in the world or is "radically out of alignment" with what they've previously observed or considered, Whitlock says.
          </p>
          <p>While an adult might respond to encountering child sexual abuse material with rage, she notes that a child is more likely to respond with deep fear. Such experiences can increase or amplify depression and anxiety, as well as make them feel helpless against injustices that other people, including children like them, may endure.

            In order to prepare yourself (and a parenting plan) for a delicate but necessary conversation with a kid or teen who has seen something awful online, consider these tips from Whitlock:.</p> 
          <p>
           <b> 1. Let your child know they can talk to you about what they see or do online.</b>
            A recent annual report from Bark, a parental monitoring service, identified key categories of inappropriate online content that young users encounter, sometimes at alarmingly high rates, like suicidal ideation, violence, disordered eating, and sexual content.
            
            The prospect of talking in advance with a young person about each type of content may seem too daunting to a parent. Some subjects may not be even developmentally appropriate to discuss with younger children.
            
            But Whitlock says parents needn't thoroughly explain the variety of awful things a child might see online. Instead, she recommends helping children and teens know that when they're experiencing uncomfortable emotions in response to content, that's a good time to talk to their parent. These feelings might include confusion, shame, embarrassment, disgust, and fear.
            
            "Kids need to be able to go say, 'I think I'm in over my head, or something's happening here that just doesn't feel right.'"
          </p>
          <p><b>2. Respond with openness when they tell you about something inappropriate.</b>
            Ideally, when a child starts that conversation, their parent will react calmly, says Whitlock. It's not helpful to shame a child for clicking on a certain link or exploring content they shouldn't have. Remember that a curious kid may Google a phrase they heard at school, not realizing what results will come back.
            
            Instead, Whitlock recommends validating whatever a child is feeling in response to the content they viewed, and remaining curious and nonjudgemental as they share more.
            She understands that conversations about concerning content are bound to make some parents feel awkward or uneasy. It's important to be mindful of those emotions and stay centered when talking to a child about their own feelings, so that the discussion stays focused on supporting the child.

            If it's in a child's best interest to restrict their access to the internet or a device based on what they viewed, parents should still avoid being overly punitive. If a child and parent had already agreed on certain boundaries that were then violated, enforcing the consequences can help a child take responsibility for how they use their device.</p>
