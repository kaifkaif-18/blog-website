          <p>A screenshot of an email purportedly by Google is circulating online, claiming that the search engine is ‘sunsetting gmail.’ The message claims that Google will shut down Gmail by August 1, 2024. While there was no official announcement by the company, netizens assumed it to be yet another development by the search engine giant to phase out a flourishing product and dump it into the Google Graveyard along with the likes of Orkut, Google+, and more. According to Gizmodo, the fake screenshot has been viewed over a million times, with as many shares. Responding to the hoax, Gmail’s X account shared an update stating that “Gmail is here to stay.”

          <p>Codenamed Caribou, Gmail was created by Paul Buchheit, and launched in 2004 on April 1. It coincides with Google’s tradition of April Fool jokes, so people were not having it, when the company announced that it was launching an email service with an unprecedented 1 GB of free space, unlike its rival Hotmail, which provided 2 MB. In June 2008, the company released Gmail Lab Features with popular settings like the “Undo Send” option. In November 2006, Gmail was made available for mobile phones as a Java-based application. The email service was released as an Android app in November 2014, becoming the first app in the Google Play Store. The same year, Gmail released the Inbox by Gmail feature, which was discontinued on April 2, 2019, by incorporating its features into the standard service.</p>
          
          <p>In July 2017, Gmail surpassed a billion active users. As of 2024, the email service has reportedly had about 1.8 billion users, with Indonesia and India accounting for the highest number of active users at 82.6% and 82.4%, respectively.
