          <p>Marvel is gearing up for Deadpool & Wolverine, while fans are gearing up for the debut of X-Men and Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool in the MCU. The first trailer gave a glimpse of what fans can expect from the film and the future of X-Men since its transition. The film will also mark MCU's first R-rated movie in over two decades, and is expected to be a laugh fest with adorable moments between Deadpool and Wolverine aka off screen best friends, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.
        </p>

          <p>The film is filled with cameos but fans are also excited for the debut of Emma Corrin, The Crown actress who will be seen playing X-Men villain Cassandra Nova. While details have not been confirmed yet, the trailer did feature a glimpse of Cassandra and fans are convinced Emma will be seen playing the villain in Deadpool 3.</p>
          
          <p>Only for a second, the trailer featured Corrin's bald head, which matches the comic book villain Cassandra Nova. The character can be seen with long pointed ears walking into a battlefield. According to reports, her role has been named right after the two leading characters Ryan Reynolds' Wade Wilson and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, confirming a massive screen time. Which in this case would be for the villain, since the film is filled with many-many cameos from X-men and other cinematic universes.

          </p>

          <p>According to reports, in the comic books, Cassandra Nova is expected to be a daunting challenge for Deadpool and Wolverine. The character first appeared in 2001 in New X-Men #114 and since has been part of major events in the Marvel comic verse. For the unversed, she also has a connection to X-men leader Charles Xavier.</p>
          
          <p>Her character in the comics does not have a significant form and in the future gets entangled with a version of Charles Xavier also explaining her appearance and powers which are similar to that of Professor X. With Cassandra's powers to manipulate the DNA of others, and ability to break it down at the molecular level, she is expected to be a powerful foe for the mutants.</p>
          
          <p>The actress Emma Corrin, has previously talked about her role during interviews. She told Empire, “I feel really excited to play a villain. I haven’t done that, and it’s an itch I want to scratch.” On the other hand, she also revealed that she does not know much about Marvel but understands the impact it has on the fans.

            She said, “Hands up, I’m not a Marvel person. I’ve watched Spider-Man and Black Panther. I was like, ‘Look, you’re gonna have to debrief me into this.’ It’s such an intricate world. There’s so much to it, it’s an absolute mind-f***. All the language and the Easter eggs, and this person is related to that person who did this, and this person came back and this person’s dead… it’s amazing.”</p>
