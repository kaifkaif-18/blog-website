          <p>OPPO is set to unveil its latest addition to the F-series lineup with the much-anticipated OPPO F25 Pro 5G, scheduled for launch on February 29. With the launch imminent, OPPO has teased eager fans with a glimpse of the device's sleek design on the official micro-site. Promising a centred punch hole notch display and a powerful triple-rear camera setup, the OPPO F25 Pro is poised to redefine smartphone photography and performance for Indian consumers.

          <p>Prepare for the upcoming OPPO F25 Pro, designed to impress with its sleek flat-edge style. Available in maroon and blue options (with official color names yet to be revealed), this phone promises lightning-fast charging thanks to its support for 67W SuperVOOC technology.</p>
          
          <p>The OPPO F25 Pro, as depicted in official renders, features a rectangular camera module on its rear panel, housing three camera sensors and an LED flash. On the right edge of the device, you'll find the volume rockers and power button for easy access and control.
          </p>
          <p>It seems that the power button does not double as a fingerprint scanner, indicating that the device will likely incorporate an in-display fingerprint sensor for security purposes.</p>
          <p>
            Additionally, there are speculations suggesting that the OPPO F25 Pro Indian variant could be a rebranded version of the OPPO Reno 11F. The Reno 11F recently launched in various South Asian markets, adding weight to the possibility of this rebranding.
