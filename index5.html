          <span>BAFTA 2024 Changes The Game As Major Oscar Contenders Don't Win; Here's What To Expect Ahead</span>
          <p>British Awards may not be the right indicator for Oscars anymore</p>

          <p>BAFTA's took place earlier this weekend, and the winners have turned out to be something that for once going to change the way Oscars is predicted. While Oppenheimer has been the constant winner throughout the awards season, the winners list did list some surprises and snubs that were rather unexpected. Apart from Oppenheimer, some other titles that made the biggest win was Poor Things and one of the biggest surprises was The Holdovers being able to build a footing in the awards season.

          <p>Oscars aka the Academy Awards often have similar winners due to similar voting members. However, in recent years ever since BAFTAs have been trying to be more diverse with their choices, it seems like things are changing for the award show. One of the biggest surprises was the win of American Fiction by Orion, Amazon MGM Studios and Curson. The film received one nomination and took it home. It was won by first-time screenwriter/director Cord Jefferson for Adapted Screenplay.</p>
          
          <p>On the other hand, all streaming services were highly snubbed from the awards night. While films like Apple TV's Killers Of The Flower Moon did not receive many nominations. Martin Scorsese was snubbed in the Best Director category and Lily Gladstone was snubbed in the lead actress category. On the other hand, Amazon acquired MGM's Saltburn received nominations but came up empty-handed, and Netflix was shut out despite seven nominations for Bradley Copper's Maestro.

          </p>

          <p>Barbie was once again left out at the BAFTA, no mentions were made for major categories either despite its great writing, direction and performances. It seems like the big box office numbers are what kept the awards away from the biggest release of the year. Even if Oppenheimer has the claim to similar fame, Barbie has been the most talked about film of the year and turned it unappealing for the voters. The same is expected to be the case for Barbie at the Academy Awards later this year.</p>
          
          <p>However, this does not mean that BAFTA is turning away from the Oscars. While the two awards have had a few rocky years in the past, they still share about 500 or so members in common. And with Oppenheimer's confirmed win for the Oscars, it seems like they will be heading back on the same path. The Holdovers has started to gain momentum rightfully for the Oscars, Emma Watson for Poor Things and Oppenheimer are still the leading contenders for the big win at the Oscars. Meanwhile, Killers of the Flower Moon is most likely to get snubbed again much like Barbie.</p>
          
          <p>BAFTA took place on Sunday night, February 18, 2024. Meanwhile, the Oscars will take place on March 11, 2024.</p>
