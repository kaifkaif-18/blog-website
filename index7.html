          <p>In collaboration with Mitsubishi Electric and autonomous robotics startup Cartken, Uber is set to launch a pioneering service in Japan utilising self-driving sidewalk robots for food delivery.
        </p>

          <p>According to a spokesperson from Uber, the service, accessible via the Uber Eats app, is slated to debut in a designated area of Tokyo by the end of March. Details regarding operating hours will be unveiled closer to the launch date.</p>
          
          <p>Uber and Cartken, co-founded in 2019 by former Google engineers behind the Bookbot project, currently operate a delivery service in Fairfax, Virginia, and Miami. This latest partnership marks their inaugural venture outside the United States and includes Mitsubishi Electric, tasked with supervising operations in Tokyo.

          </p>
          <p>Meet the Model C

            Cartken's autonomous sidewalk robot, the Model C, will spearhead the delivery service. Equipped with a 27-litre insulated cargo bin, the robot travels at approximately 3.3 miles per hour. Loaded with sensors and advanced software, including cameras, it can navigate its environment autonomously. Cartken also provides a remote monitoring and guidance system, enabling workers to supervise the robot remotely if needed.</p>
          <p>
            Mitsubishi Electric employees trained in Cartken's remote guidance system will utilize Cartken's teleoperations interface, as stated by an Uber spokesperson.
