          <p>Even the side quest/recap is worth it</p>

          <p>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba is one of the most beloved anime shows in the sh≈çnen genre. After the manga wrapped up the anime is also steadily heading towards its final arc. The series is known for some of its best fight sequences and previously has released one of its arcs as a movie. Hashira Training arc also follows a similar pattern. While Mugen Train Arc showcased the entire arc in just one film, Hashira Training only introduces the set-up for the upcoming season. Reports have revealed that the arc will be released in three different movies, but it is unclear at the moment.
        </p>

          <p>The first film showcases a major recap of the previous seasons as well as the amazing climatic ending of the Swordsmith village arc. From the final battle to Nezuko conquering the sun and Muzan's plan for her, most of which has already been part of the previous season the anime gets a big screen treatment for the film and it does not disappoint with the changes in the artworks. While it is minimalist, fans should be able to stop the difference between the series' treatment than the big screen even in the voice acting.</p>
          
          <p>Muzan appears to be more menacing on the big screen and with his intentions and powers being revealed, he is turning out to be more deadly even without much of his presence in the film. The film's run time lasts 2 hours 10 minutes and comprises of two full length episodes, the second half being the actual introduction to Hashira Training and the need for it.</p>

          <p>The highlight of the movie remains the same as the previous seasons of the show, but one scene with the Hashira's fighting a huge hoard of demons trumps it all. We also get to see a glimpse of Muzan's castle and the two Hashira being only inches away from it. Some of the other scenes that are unmissable include Nezuko's development and her interaction with Zenitsu and Inosuke. Natsuki Hanae's voice acting for Tanjiro's extremely positive character versus Hiro Shimono's voice acting for Zenitsu is always an unmissable contrast to come across.</p>
          
          <p>The screenplay continues to get the anime series treatment but the longer run time makes up for all else. The fight sequences are more dramatic for the big screen which makes for a great cinematic experience with the comic charm the show cannot seem to shake off. And shouldn't. Laughs, tears and thrill continue to come at regular intervals with immensely cute and insanely good artwork.</p>
          
          <p>Overall, despite knowing the story and its impact, the film Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - To The Hashira makes for an edge-of-your-seat watch.</p>
