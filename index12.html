          <p>Medha Shankr's journey from aspiring actor to leading lady in the critically acclaimed film 12th Fail is a testament to perseverance, passion, and the power of believing in one's dreams. Directed by the renowned Vidhu Vinod Chopra and inspired by the real-life experiences of IPS Officer Manoj Kumar Sharma and IRS Officer Shraddha Joshi, the film has captivated audiences and critics alike, earning the coveted top spot on the Top 250 list of top-rated Indian movies chart on IMDb, with an impressive user rating of 9.1.

            Starring Medha Shankr alongside the talented Vikrant Massey in the lead roles, 12th Fail has garnered widespread acclaim for its poignant storytelling, compelling performances, and powerful portrayal of real-life struggles and triumphs. For Shankr, landing the role was the culmination of years of dedication and hard work in pursuit of her passion for acting.</p>
          
          <p>In a recent conversation with IMDb, Shankr shared insights into her journey to securing the role in 12th Fail, recounting the rigorous audition process Shankr revealed, "It took me quite some time to land 12th Fail. I started my journey as an actor in Bombay in 2018, and it was in 2022 when I first auditioned for the film at a casting agency. Then, I underwent a screen test with Vidhu Vinod Chopra sir and the entire team. During my first screen test with Vidhu sir, Vikrant, and the team, I had a strong intuition that this role was meant for me. Finally, I received a call from Vidhu sir confirming that I am the leading lady of our film."
          <p>However, Shankr's path to success was not without its challenges. Recalling a particularly difficult period in 2020 when she was facing financial hardship in Mumbai, the actor candidly shared her struggles and the resilience that kept her going. "It was 2020, a devastating year for many reasons worldwide. It was also tough for me because I was fully broke; I had only 257 rupees in my account," she revealed.</p> 
          <p>
            Since rising to prominence, Shankr has garnered widespread acclaim and adoration, earning the title of the 'National Crush.' While she appreciates the recognition and the joy it brings, Shankr remains grounded and focused on her craft, recognizing the transient nature of fame and aspiring for longevity in her career. "I am thoroughly enjoying the moment," she remarked. "However, I also understand that it’s transient, and I hope it’s not."
